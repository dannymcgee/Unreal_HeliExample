## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) installed on your system.

1. Open a terminal in your Unreal projects directory (by default `~/Documents/Unreal Projects` on Windows)
1. Run:
    ```sh
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/dannymcgee/Unreal_HeliExample.git ./HeliExample
    ```
1. Navigate into the `HeliExample` directory, right-click the `HeliExample.uproject` file, and select **Generate Visual Studio project files**
1. Open `HeliExample.sln` in Visual Studio
1. Run the default **HeliExample | Development Editor** target
